> **Less Bullshit. More Innovation.** ‚ö°

I'm passionate about **actual innovation** and building products that don't suck. Currently leading a company in Mauritius called thundergear.io where we craft exceptional web experiences, power e-commerce solutions, and cook up some seriously cool side projects that push boundaries. I also manage partnerships for an upcoming tech non-profit organization called Dodocore and run the only Mauritian mastodon server moris.social
